# Best Practices

1. **Use Appropriate Punctuation**  
   Add punctuation where suitable, and ensure that each text paragraph ends with proper punctuation whenever possible.  

2. **Use the YYYY/MM/DD Date Format**  
   For example, use `2025/01/01`.  

3. **Match Voice with Language Whenever Possible**  
   Each voice is optimized for a specific language; however, our model supports seamless mixed-language reading in Chinese and English.  

4. **Use WebSocket API for Streaming Audio**  
   For audio that needs to sound highly continuous and human-like, opt for the WebSocket API interface to ensure smooth, real-time output.
